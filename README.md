# WEB103 Prework - * Ye Almighty Creatorverse*

Submitted by: Evan Lu

About this web app: The implemented web app serves as a personalized interface for
storing information about one's favorite creators. Information about these creators are 
stored in small cards which can easily be edited and added. Creator Cards can be added
in any view by pressing the button "Add Creator" and you can always return to the home
page with all the Creator Cards by pressing the button "View All Creators". Creator 
Cards are displayed on the home page with a picture of the Creator's brand.

In the home page, you can click on any given creator to either view their information
or edit their information (which you can also do while viewing their information). 
Their information consists of their name, a short description, a photo of their brand,
as well as optional links to their socials (YT and Instagram). This information can
be edited in the edit screen as well as deleted from the application. 

Time spent: 7 hours
